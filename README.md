# Sign Based Video Trimmer
Used OpenCV and Convolutional Neural Networks to create checkpoints and trim videos accordingly.

# How it works:
The way this program works is that it creates save and delete checkpoints when you show thumbs up or thumbs down symbol in the designation region of the window. So, at the end of execution of program only the video in between 'save checkpoints' is saved and the remaining part is deleted.<br>
This is helpful for non video-editors as it saves them time which would otherwise be spent in trimming and joining those parts of the video.

# Steps to run the project on your computer:
Clone this repository and run video_trimmer.py
